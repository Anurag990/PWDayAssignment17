Question 1- What is Mutable String in java Explain with an example.
Answer - It is a type of string in which we create a string, on that string if we try to perform any operation and if those changes get reflected in the same object then 
such Strings are called "Mutable String"
Example - StringBuffer, StringBuilder

StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Virat");
sb.append("Kohli");//Just like concat
System.out.println(sb);
